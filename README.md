# A* Pathfinding Algorithm
Purpose
The A* pathfinding algorithm is a widely used method for finding the shortest path in a graph, particularly in grid-based maps. It combines the advantages of Dijkstra's algorithm and Greedy Best-First Search by using a heuristic function to guide the search. This project implements the A\* algorithm to demonstrate its efficiency and versatility.

#Features
1) Handles various grid sizes and obstacles.

2) Provides visualization of the pathfinding process.

3) Configurable heuristic functions for custom use cases.
   
# Setup Instructions

Clone this repository:
git clone https://github.com/username/repository-name.git

Navigate to the project directory:
cd repository-name

Install required dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the program:
python main.py

# Usage
1) Start the application and input the grid size.

2) Set obstacles by clicking on the grid cells.

3) Select the start and end points for the path.

4) Choose a heuristic function (e.g., Manhattan distance, Euclidean distance).

5) Click "Find Path" to visualize the A\* algorithm in action.
